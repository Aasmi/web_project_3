# Project: From Portland to Portland

### Recent Updates
 This is the first project in this series of projects which is adaptable on different resolution of screen. It has a good collection of mix of Elements to develop understanding of informational website.

**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. The technologies that are used in this project are:
   1. HTML
   2. CSS
   3. Figma [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/xM9rNsdK4iNcFJmDZho3Aw/Sprint-3%3A-From-Portland-to-Portland-%2F-desktop-%2B-mobile?node-id=500%3A0)

**Setup Instructions**

Clone the current Repository, in your local directory.

``` git clone https://github.com/Aasmi/web_project_3
```

Open ```index.html``` file.

**Future Improvements**
1. Find more destinations across US and document the Photographic Journey as part of the collection on this website.
2. Accept user Inputs for new location suggestions.
3. Develop user rating based on the content of each Journey.
